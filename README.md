# Ecommerce DB Creation.sql
This script handles the database schema setup:

## 1. Deletes existing data and drops tables if they exist.
## 2. Creates the following tables:
e_Customers, e_Products, e_Orders, e_Order_Details, and e_Payments.
## 3. Sets up constraints:
Foreign keys for relationships (e.g., orders linked to customers).
A CHECK constraint for Payment_Status.
The structure is clear and aligned with relational database design principles.
